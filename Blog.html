            <h1 class="font-color">Panoramic Park Alicia,Bohol</h1>
            <div class="spotDesc">
            <p>Origin/History:Alicia Panoramic Park is located in Alicia, a town around 2.5 hours away from Tagbilaran City, Bohol. Its peak, Binabaje Hills, rises 400 meters above sea level and is covered in long cogon grass. The town is also where Alicia Schist, the oldest known rock in Bohol, can be found. These rocks are believed to have existed since the near end of the Jurrasic Era, which is the era of dinosaurs, to the early Cretaceous Era, around 145-100 Million years ago.
                </p>
             <p>
                What to do:The entrance fee is 30 pesos, and you can also hire a local guide for 300 pesos for the day hike and can pay an additional 500 pesos if you plan to go camping with 5 people. Tents and trekking poles are available for rent as well. The duration of the hike can take about 1.5 hours to 4 hours depending on your pace.

             </p>

             <p>
                Food to eat:Bringing your own food is a must since it is a hiking trail, but there are snacks and drinks for sale at the registration area, so make sure to buy what you need.

             </p>
             <p>
                Transportation:Public transportation from Dao Integrated Bus Terminal takes more or less 3 hours via bus or van. A motorbike or private transport is ideal too since they have a wide parking space available.

            <h1 class="font-color">Can-Umantad Falls Candijay,Bohol</h1>
            <div class="spotDesc">
            <p>Origin/History:Can-Umanted Falls is in the Candijay region (pronounced â€˜Candee-highâ€™). It was named after its height. Years ago, there was no road that went all the way around to Cam-Umantad Waterfall.
            </p>
            <p>
                What to do:There is a rice terrace near the waterfall if you walk down the steps. It will take a 15-minute walk to the waterfall down the steps. The entrance fee is about 20 pesos. There are a lot of great spots, you can head on up to the main waterfall, which is the tallest waterfall in the province. The main cascade is 60ft but hits a plateau before dropping down to the main pool.

            </p>
            <p>
                Food to eat:There is a restaurant near the waterfall. It's like a 2-in-1 attraction. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Transportation:There is a great tour that takes you from your hotel in Panglao to the beaches of Anda, Candapdapan Rice Terraces, and to Can-Umantad Waterfall. It is about a 2-hour journey from Panglao, arriving in the Candijay Region, it is actually not super easy to find with a number of dirt roads to follow.

            <p>
                Origin/History:Combento Cave, located in Anda, is just a few distance away from the provincial road, there lies another must-visit spot called Combento Cave. This cave, indeed is not your ordinary cave. Itâ€™s a cave pool. You can literally enjoy swimming inside. Though the whole chamber is not that big, the deepest part of the water measures more than 6 feet - enough to have your whole body in a standing position submerged. As to where the water came from, it remains a mystery. It seems it just springs out from the ground. The close proximity of the cave to the seashore might also be the reason why this cave has water in it.

            </p>
            <p>
                What to do there:Explore the cave system, go spelunking, marvel at the natural formations, and learn about the caveâ€™s geological history. Be there early in the morning when there are still a few tourists around; the place gets crowded throughout the day.

            </p>
            <p>
                Food to eat:Food vendors might not be nearby. So best to bring your own food and drinks.
